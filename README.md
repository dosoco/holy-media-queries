# Holy Media Queries

Your goal is to use Flexbox and Media Queries to get the three layouts in the assets directory.

* You may take code from Holy Flail if you want!
* The "breakpoints" (viewport sizes at which you change layouts) are up to you.
* Do not worry about the finer points of the margins and padding; it's layout and responsiveness we're focusing on.
* Much has been provided for you, including some wrapping divs you might take advnatage of. *Check out* the html, and add elements/ids/classes if it will help you, but you shouldn't actually *have* to edit it.
